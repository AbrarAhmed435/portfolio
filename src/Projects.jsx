          <h3>HEART DISEASE ESTIMATE</h3>
          <p>
            Developed a Heart Disease Prediction web app using Machine Learning
            with Python. The project utilizes a CSV-based dataset and leverages
            libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn for data
            preprocessing, feature selection, and model training. The trained
            model is integrated into a Flask backend, serving predictions via a
            simple and responsive HTML frontend. This project demonstrates
            end-to-end ML deployment, from data analysis to user interaction.
